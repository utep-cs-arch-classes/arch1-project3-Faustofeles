## Project Description

This game is called the PAD MANIA. It's a two player game where each player takes
control of a paddle. It is design to have three segments:

    - Instruction set screen
    - Gameplay screen
    - Gameover screen



## Your Task

The Goal is to bounce a flying ball off your paddle and send it back to the other
player, then the other player has the responsibility to send the ball back to you.
Whoever fails to hit the ball with its paddle will grant a point in favor to the
other player. The ball will increase its velocity as points are accumulated by both
players, making the game more challenging as you go along. The player that reaches
7 points will be declared the winner.

## Getting Started

Commands are really simple to follow. Each player will use two buttons to move his/her
respective paddle up or down. The instructions are as follows:

       For Player 1:
           S1 - UP
           S2 - DOWN

       For Player 2:
           S3 - UP
           S4 - DOWN
